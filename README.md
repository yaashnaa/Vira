# 🌿 Vira — A Gentle Wellness Companion  
**Launching June 5 on TestFlight**

Vira is a research-backed wellness app designed to support users navigating depression, anxiety, or eating disorder recovery. Unlike traditional wellness apps focused on streaks, goals, or calorie counts, Vira prioritizes emotional safety, user autonomy, and sustainable self-care.

Built with behavioral psychology and ethical UX principles, Vira adapts to the user — not the other way around.
